    others. For example, the simple act of supporting necessary—but
    unglamorous and underfunded—needs can make those dollars go further and

            Disaster victims can survive for several days without food, but only
            for a short time without water. Water from streams, lakes and local
            water systems can become contaminated; therefore, it is best to store
            a supply of water in the shelter area.

            Flooding is an overflow of water that can range from a few inches deep
            to fully submerging entire buildings. Flooding can occur when rivers
            and lakes cannot contain excessive rain or snow melt, or when rain
            cannot be absorbed fully into the ground.
